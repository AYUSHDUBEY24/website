 ## 🎯 Objective
 In the flood of daily news, readers often create quick summaries but lose track of them over time. 
 There is no simple tool that lets users generate summaries at different lengths, across languages, 
 and keep a history of all summaries they have made for easy reference and comparison.
 Sumarise is designed for busy readers, researchers, students, and journalists who need to quickly 
 summarize news articles into various levels of detail, sometimes in different languages. 
 Importantly, it stores all past summaries, allowing users to revisit, reuse, or track how information 
 was condensed at different points in time.

 ## 🧠 Team & Approach
 
 ### Team Name:  
 `Reboot Rebels`
 
 ### Team Members:  
 - Ayush Dubey (GitHub / LinkedIn / Role)  
 - Ishika Garg    
 
 ### Your Approach:  
 - Why we chose this problem - We noticed that while many tools offer article summarization, few allow users to generate summaries of different lengths,
   in multiple languages, and keep a history of all their summaries. We wanted to build something that is not just a one-time summarizer, but a smarter,
   user-focused tool for ongoing use. 
 - Key challenges you addressed-A major challenge was setting up and managing API keys for different services (like language models and translation tools).
   We also had to deal with backend server setup, making sure everything runs reliably, processes requests quickly, and stores user data securely.  
 - Any pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking-Initially, we focused only on summarizing articles, but during brainstorming we realized
   adding summary history tracking would make the tool way more powerful and user-friendly. Another breakthrough was deciding to make summaries adapt to
   different lengths — short, medium, or detailed — instead of giving users just one fixed version. We also added summary mode feature -which provides the user with
   options for "focus on facts","key takaways" or "Simplified" versions of the summary.
